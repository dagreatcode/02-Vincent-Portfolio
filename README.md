## Description 

Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. A well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. An important component of your GitHub profile‚Äîand one that many new developers often overlook‚Äîis the README.md file.

The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub.

There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very anemic one. This guide outlines a few best practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README.

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

## User Story

Part of being a developer is putting yourself in the shoes of your audience and imagining their experience with the application you‚Äôre creating. 

A user story, or persona, is a description of an application using natural, non-technical language. Written from the perspective of the application‚Äôs end user, they help developers organize their work by allowing them to understand an application‚Äôs context and who will be using it.

## Criteria

Acceptance criteria are the requirements that must be met to complete a user story. They define the boundaries of the user story and are used to confirm when a story is completed.

These criteria can be thought of as instructions for how you should complete a homework assignment. As you plan how to build the application, use them to structure your pages and pseudocode your logic. As you‚Äôre working, look back at the list of acceptance criteria to make sure you‚Äôve met all of them. An application is complete only when it meets all of these criteria.

## Review

In the real world, when a developer finishes working on an issue, another developer reviews the code, providing feedback on errors and making sure that all of the acceptance criteria have been met. For the homework assignments, your TAs will serve as your reviewers.

To submit your application for review, you are required to provide the following:

* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.

### Quiz to Myself:
* Which browsers support HTML5?

* Which two attributes should every <img> tag should have?

* What's the difference between a class selector and an id selector?

* Why is it preferable to use external style sheets instead of inline CSS?

* What are the advantages of using Git?


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

* [Description](#description)
* [User Story](#user_story)
* [Criteria](#Criteria)
* [Review](#review)
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.


## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.



## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges



[![Created Badge](https://badges.pufler.dev/created/puf17640/git-badges)](https://badges.pufler.dev)

<!-- [![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org/) -->

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.


## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
